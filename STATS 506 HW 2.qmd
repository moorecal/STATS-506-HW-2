# STATS 506 HW 2

## Problem 1 - Modified Random Walk

### a) (with loop)

```{r}
#' Random walk with loops. 50% chance of moving +-1, if +1 is chosen then a 5% chance of moving +10 rather than just +1, if -1 is chosen then a 20% chance of moving -3 rather than just -1.
#' @param count how many steps the random walk will take
#' @returns the final value once the steps are completed
random_walk1 <- function(count){
  walk <- 0
  for(i in 1:count){
    #take the initial sample for the +-1
    sample_1 <- sample(c(-1, 1), 1)
    #conditions for the extra possible +10 or -3 move
    if(sample_1 == 1){
      sample_2 <- sample(c(1, 10), 1, prob = c(0.95, 0.05))
      walk <- walk + sample_2
    }
    else{
      sample_3 <- sample(c(-1, -3), 1, prob = c(0.8, 0.2))
      walk <- walk + sample_3
    }
  }
  return(walk)
}
```

### a) (vectorized)

```{r}

```


```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```
